# Prime-Donut.js
I have created something stunning, truly a masterpiece, of which most of it I am not responsible for. It's a modified version of petercunha's work. 

I have made it into 3 seperate files, because 3 files labelled donut ALWAYS looks better in your file explorer.

I made it rainbow, I made it bigger, I made it better.

You're Welcome
